# School District Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
Using Python and Pandas, an analysis of the high schools within a certain school district was conducted.  The analysis was completed at the request of the school board in order to make funding decisions for the upcoming school year.  The school board requested that the original analysis be updated after academic dishonesty was discovered within the ninth-grade scores from Thomas High School.  The following analysis has removed those scores from the data.
## Results
